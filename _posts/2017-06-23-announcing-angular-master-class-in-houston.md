#### Angular 4 Master Class

It's been a couple of month since we've last run our training in the USA, so we are very pleased to announce that our Angular Master Class is coming to **Houston in August!**

We found the perfect, artsy venue that will get everyone into the right piece of mind to learn the nuances and power of Angular 4. The event takes place on the **August 22 - 25, 2017** in the Bisong Art Gallery.

You or your team should attend our 4-day **Angular 4 Master Class** training.

*  Day 1: Jump Start with full, high-level introduction to Angular
*  Day 2: Observables & Component Architecture
*  Day 3: Routing & Forms
*  Day 4: Redux + ngrx with immutable, 1-way dataflows and reactive programming


This is the first time we'll run a public **4-day** training! The reason we added another day is because we want to teach our brand new material on  **Redux and ngrx**.

If you would like private, onsite training for a team of 10 or more developers, please contact us at hello@thoughtram.io.

#### About the Training

These are intense, full 8-hour days... but don't worry, we make the classroom fun. thoughtram teaches the class with two (2) trainers. And almost every 30 minutes, students work with hands-on, coding lab exercises.

We also have social time after class on Day 2 and Day 4... for networking, offline questions, and simply relaxing with fellow Angular-philes.

Come to our training... have a blast and get the best acceleration into Angular 4 possible. And use the public training to expand your Angular community network.
